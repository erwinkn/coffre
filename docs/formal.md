# A model of the locking protocol

coffre's app and vault share one database. The vault decides every access,
and the audit log's head row serialises appends and decisions
([single-database.md](design/single-database.md), "Transactions, locks and
serialised decisions"). The tests and the property tests run operations one
after another. The races are in how operations interleave, and two of them
reached #134's review, found only by reasoning. So the protocol is also
written as a TLA+ specification, and TLC checks it over every interleaving
of a few concurrent requests:

```sh
pnpm formal                  # every scenario, about a minute
scripts/formal.sh Deletion   # one, with its runs without a protection
```

- [`formal/Coffre.tla`](../formal/Coffre.tla) is the model: the state, one
  step per SQL statement, and the invariants.
- [`formal/MC.tla`](../formal/MC.tla) holds the scenarios: who runs what, and
  from which state. Each one has a configuration, `formal/<Name>.cfg`.
- [`scripts/formal.sh`](../scripts/formal.sh) downloads TLC, checks its
  checksum and runs everything.
- [`scripts/formal-trace.mjs`](../scripts/formal-trace.mjs) prints a
  counterexample one step per line.

CI runs it in the *Formal model* job of `validate.yml`.

## What it checks

Every scenario must hold. Then each one runs again with one of the code's
protections turned off, and must fail on the invariant that protection
keeps. If a change to the model ever stopped it seeing a race it once
caught, that run would pass, and the script fails. Each of these
counterexamples is printed in CI's log.

| Protection, in the code | Turned off, TLC finds | Found by |
|---|---|---|
| A deletion re-reads the place's grants under the head (`projects.ts`, `granted_meanwhile`) | a grant left on a deleted place, which no path can revoke (`EveryGrantRevocable`) | #134's review |
| `setAccess` reads whether the place is deleted after taking the head | the same, from the other order | #134 |
| A deletion re-checks under the head that the place is archived (`restored`) | a place erased after it was restored (`DeletedOnlyWhenArchived`) | #134's review |
| A rename, archive or restore resolves the place again under the head (`stillThere`) | a tombstone given back a live slug, or un-archived (`TombstonesKeepTheirSlug`, `TombstonesStayArchived`) | this model, fixed in #147 |
| A key decision re-checks the place under the head (`#keys`) | a key released after its place's deletion committed (`NothingReleasedAfterDeletion`, `DeletedStaysUnreachable`) | this model, fixed in #147 |
| Adding an environment resolves its project again under the head, and reads whether it is archived there (`putEnvironment`, `stillThere`) | an environment added to a deleted project (`DeletedStaysUnreachable`) | reported with #147, fixed in #149 |
| Renaming, archiving or restoring a key resolves its environment again under the head (`patchSecret`, `checkEnvironment`) | a key renamed in a deleted place, its tombstone's names changed (`DeletedStaysUnreachable`) | reported with #147, fixed in #149 |
| Sign-in re-reads the member's generation under the head (`#stillMember`) | a credential issued at a generation a removal had moved past (`CredentialsAtCurrentGeneration`) | |
| Member rows are locked in principal order (`lockMembers`) | two decisions waiting on each other (`NoWaitCycle`) | |
| A read decides under the reader's row, which a revocation or a removal locks too (`#keys`, through `#decide`) | a value released to a member after their removal committed (`NothingReleasedAfterRevocation`) | |
| A read through a reference checks again, under the head, that it has not ended (`unwrap`'s `vet`, run again in `underLock`) | a value read through a reference after it was broken (`NothingReleasedThroughEndedReference`) | |
| Making a reference checks its source again under the head (`secrets.ts`, `setSecrets`) | a reference made to a source archived or deleted meanwhile (`ReferencedSourcesStayLive`) | #152 |
| Archiving is refused while a live reference from elsewhere reads the place (`references.ts`, `refuseIfRead`) | a live reference reading an archived source (`ReferencedSourcesStayLive`) | #152 |
| A deletion re-reads the references into and out of the place under the head (`projects.ts`, `referenced_meanwhile`) | a reference held in a deleted place, which no path can break, and whose source can never be archived (`EveryReferenceBreakable`) | this model, fixed in #155 |

Here is #134's first race, as `scripts/formal.sh` prints it, with the grant
re-read turned off:

- Olga deletes the archived project. Her scope read finds Ada's grant on
  the environment, and the vault revokes it (steps 4 to 11).
- Omar then grants Ada the project (13 to 20).
- Olga's transaction commits the deletion (22).
- Ada's grant on the project outlives it, and no path can name the place to
  revoke it.

```
  4. deleter   DeleteScope     delete proj by olga     -> delete.next
 11. deleter   CallCommit      delete proj by olga     -> delete.next     grants -ada@env; log +access.revoke ada@env (deleter); head deleter -> none
 12. deleter   DeleteNext      delete proj by olga     -> delete.head
 14. admin     GrantResolve    grant ada@proj by omar  -> call.lock
 20. admin     CallCommit      grant ada@proj by omar  -> idle            log +access.grant ada@proj (admin); grants +ada@proj
 21. deleter   DeleteHead      delete proj by olga     -> delete.commit   head none -> deleter
 22. deleter   DeleteCommit    delete proj by olga     -> idle            log +delete proj (deleter); slug[proj] s1 -> tomb; held true -> false
```

And the second, with the archived re-check turned off: Omar restores the
project after Olga's revocations and before her transaction, and the
deletion erases a live project.

```
 12. deleter   DeleteNext      delete proj by olga     -> delete.head
 16. admin     PatchCommit     unarchive proj by omar  -> idle            archived[proj] true -> false
 17. deleter   DeleteHead      delete proj by olga     -> delete.commit   head none -> deleter
 18. deleter   DeleteCommit    delete proj by olga     -> idle            log +delete proj (deleter); slug[proj] s1 -> tomb; held true -> false
```

And the race this model found in references, with the re-read turned
off. Olga deletes the archived holder's environment, and her scope read
finds no reference (steps 7 to 9). Meanwhile it is restored, its key is
made a reference to the secret, and it is archived again (10 to 25). The
deletion commits (27), and the reference is still live, held in a
tombstone: no path names its holder to break it, and archiving its source
is refused while it reads it.

```
  8. deleter   DeleteScope       delete hold by olga        -> delete.next
 14. admin     PatchCommit       unarchive hold by olga     -> idle            head admin -> none; archived[hold] true -> false
 23. maker     ReferCommit       refer hold by olga         -> idle            ref none -> maker; head maker -> none
 25. admin     PatchCommit       archive hold by olga       -> idle            head admin -> none; archived[hold] false -> true
 27. deleter   DeleteCommit      delete hold by olga        -> idle            head deleter -> none; slug[hold] s1 -> tomb; log +delete hold (deleter)
```

Each line is one step:
- the process that took it;
- the step, an action of `Coffre.tla`;
- the operation it belongs to;
- the step that process takes next;
- what changed in the rows, the locks and the log.

Traces are shortened here; the script prints every step.

## The invariants

| Invariant | What must hold in every state |
|---|---|
| No deadlock | TLC's own check: a run that can no longer finish is reported |
| `NoWaitCycle` | No request waits, however indirectly, for itself |
| `EveryGrantRevocable` | Every grant is on a standing place, which the API can name and so revoke |
| `NothingReleasedAfterDeletion` | No `secret.read` follows a place's deletion in the log |
| `DeletedStaysUnreachable` | Nor does anything else that reads, writes or grants there: a `key.wrap`, a `secret.write`, an `access.grant`, an `environment.create` or a key's rename, archive or restore |
| `DeletedOnlyWhenArchived` | A deletion commits only on a place that is archived when it commits |
| `TombstonesKeepTheirSlug`, `TombstonesStayArchived` | A deleted place stays deleted, and archived |
| `AuditBeforeRelease` | A value reaches its caller only once its `secret.read` entry has committed |
| `CredentialsAtCurrentGeneration` | A credential is issued to an active member, at the generation they hold when it commits |
| `NothingReleasedAfterRevocation` | No `secret.read` for a member follows the `access.revoke` or `member.remove` that took their last grant covering where it was decided, unless an `access.grant` covering it again comes between |
| `NothingReleasedThroughEndedReference` | No `secret.read` through a reference follows its `reference.end`, or the deletion of its source's place or its holder's, in the log |
| `EveryReferenceBreakable` | A reference that has not ended is held in a standing place, where the API can name its holder, and so break it |
| `ReferencedSourcesStayLive` | And its source is neither archived nor deleted |

## The model

- **Steps.** Each step is one SQL statement, or a run of statements that
  nothing can interleave with, because the step holds the lock they need.
  Isolation is READ COMMITTED: a statement reads what was committed when it
  ran, and a transaction's writes become visible when it commits.
- **Locks.** Two kinds, each held to the end of its transaction:
  - a member's row, taken one row at a time, in principal order;
  - the log's head.

  A process whose next step takes a lock that another holds simply cannot
  take it until that lock is released: that is the wait.
- **Requests.** Each is a process, which runs a bounded number of
  operations, choosing each from its set:
  - read a value, or write one;
  - grant or revoke;
  - delete, archive, restore or rename a place;
  - add an environment, or rename, archive or restore a key;
  - sign in;
  - remove a member;
  - rotate the vault's key;
  - make a reference, or break one.
- **Each operation** follows its code path. For example, a read takes these
  steps:
  - the app resolves the path outside any transaction;
  - the vault reads the version, unlocked;
  - the vault locks the reader's row and checks their standing and the place;
  - it takes the head, appends `secret.read` and commits;
  - the app decrypts.

  A read through a reference takes the same steps. The reader's grants on
  the holder decide, and both places, and whether the reference ended, are
  checked under the row and again under the head.

  A deletion reads its scope and the references into and out of the
  place. It revokes through `setAccess` (the same steps as a grant), ends
  the references through the vault's `endReferences`, then takes the head
  and re-checks, erases and renames in one transaction.

  Making a reference: the app checks both places, the vault seals it with
  `reference.create` under the maker's row and the head, the reference it
  replaces is ended, then the app writes its row under the head.

### The scenarios

| Scenario | Who runs what | States |
|---|---|---|
| `Deletion` | One owner deletes a project or an environment, twice. Another grants, revokes, restores or renames, twice | 22 thousand |
| `Reading` | A place is archived, then deleted. Meanwhile a root admin, a holder of a grant on every project and a holder of a project grant read and write there, and an owner adds an environment or renames a key, twice | 19 thousand |
| `Members` | A member signs in, reads and writes, while an owner removes them or changes their grants, and the vault rotates its key | 249 thousand |
| `Locks` | Two owners change each other's grants and remove a member, while the vault rotates its key, which locks every member's row | 15 thousand |
| `Mixed` | Two owners run nearly every operation on places and grants, while a member reads, writes, signs in or rotates | 1 million |
| `References` | A member reads through a reference while an owner breaks it, makes it again, or revokes or removes the reader, and either place is archived, then deleted | 113 thousand |
| `Referencing` | An owner makes a reference while another archives, restores and archives again either place, and a third deletes one | 13 thousand |

Every scenario starts from one project and its one environment, holding one
secret. A third environment, in another project, holds a key that is a
reference to that secret in `References`, and none yet elsewhere.

## What it abstracts

- **App rows.** Each is locked only under the head, which every app
  transaction takes first (`audited`), so they never decide who waits.
  Foreign-key share locks are compatible with `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` and are
  left out too.
- **Refusal entries.** A refusal rolls back and appends its entries in a
  transaction that takes the head alone. It can wait for nobody and decides
  nothing, so it is left out.
- **Roles.** A grant is a grant. Which role allows what is a pure function,
  which the property tests check ([property-tests.md](property-tests.md)).
- **Grants on one environment slug in every project** (`*/prod`). They are
  checked exactly as grants on every project are, and are modelled as those.
- **The key service.** A remote KEK's intent transaction, budget and
  partial outages are left out. The key decision is modelled as with a
  local KEK, which holds the same locks in the same order.
- **Retries.** A write whose version moved prepares again in the code; in
  the model it ends. A deletion asked again is a second operation.
- **Admission and restoring a member**, checkpoints, sessions beyond their
  generation, and lapsed grants.
- **References, to their shape.**
  - There is one holder and one source, in different projects. A holder
    inside what is archived, which doesn't block the archive, is left out.
  - A holder given a value of its own ends its reference with the same
    vault call as making another, so only the latter is modelled. Making
    it again to the source it already reads replaces it in the model,
    where the code leaves it unchanged.
  - A reference whose write stored no row is ended as `abandoned`
    afterwards. In the model such a reference has no row, so nothing reads
    through it either way, and the end is left out.
  - Left out because they decide nothing about locks or ends: a source
    that is itself a reference, archiving a single key, and a read refused
    because the source's version moved.

## What it does not prove

- **That the code is the model.** The model was written from the code, and
  each step names the function it stands for. Nothing checks that they stay
  alike. A change to the order of locks or re-checks in `vault.ts`,
  `projects.ts`, `secrets.ts`, `references.ts` or `signin.ts` should change
  `Coffre.tla` in the same pull request.
- **Beyond the bounds.** The bounds are three places, a few members, and three
  or four requests of one to three operations each. Races that need more are
  not explored. The races found so far needed two requests, or three for
  the one in references.
- **Liveness.** It checks that nothing bad happens, not that every request
  finishes. A deadlock does show, since every run is finite.
- **Postgres itself.** It assumes Postgres's row locks and READ COMMITTED
  behave as documented. It does not cover SQLite, where every transaction
  holds the whole file and so nothing interleaves.
- **Security outside concurrency:** MACs, the chain, the database's owner.

## TLC

[TLC](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus) is the TLA+ tools' explicit-state
model checker. It explores breadth first, so every counterexample is a
shortest one.

- **Version:** `tla2tools.jar` 1.7.4, released 2024-08-05, the latest
  stable release. It is one jar with no dependencies, pinned in
  `scripts/formal.sh` by SHA-256 and checked before every use.
- **Not 1.8.0:** that tag is a prerelease, rebuilt nightly, which no pin
  would hold.
- **Java:** TLC needs Java 11 or newer. CI's `ubuntu-24.04` runners carry
  Java 17, so the job installs nothing else.
- **Other tools considered:**
  - Apalache checks symbolically, by trace length, and is much larger.
  - Quint's simulator samples traces rather than covering every one, and
    its exhaustive mode downloads Apalache at run time.
